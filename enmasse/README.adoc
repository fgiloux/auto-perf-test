This page contains the instructions to set up and configure https://github.com/EnMasseProject/enmasse[EnMasse] for the purpose of the performance tests that are demonstrated in this project. Nothing prevents you to use a different messaging broker, EnMasse is however a perfect fit for test automation as it is possible to get shared or dedicated brokers provisioned on demand and running on OpenShift/Kubernetes.

== Deployment

The deployment is pretty straightforward. I used what was the current release at the time I set my environment up https://github.com/EnMasseProject/enmasse/releases/tag/0.19.0[0.19.0].
Once you have cloned the repository you can follow the http://enmasse.io/documentation/0.19.0/[instructions] to deploy EnMasse. In short the following will have the user admin deploying the EnMasse components in the perftest project using provided ansible playbook:
[source,bash]
----
$ oc new-project perftest
create a persitence volume as statefulset requires it,one can use the template provided here(oc create -f brokerpv.yaml )
$ ./enmasse-0.19.0/deploy-openshift.sh -n perftest -u admin
----

A route then gets created for you, which provides access to the EnMasse console.

By selecting the Addresses menu on the left and clicking on the Create button on the top it is possible to create a queue. For the purpose of this demo you will need to create two queues: *input.queue* and *output.queue* as pooled queues.

== Certificates

Extracting the certificate that will be used to connect to the broker and importing it in a java keystore can easily be done with:
[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir amqp-certs
$ oc extract secret/external-certs-messaging --to=amqp-certs
$ keytool -v -import -file amqp-certs/tls.crt -alias cacrt -keystore amqp-certs/amqp.jks
----
